# processor-scheduling-model
Agent-Based NetLogo model of processor scheduling on CPUs

This is a neat model of an agent-based approach to processor scheduling on CPUs.  I wrote it for the Complexity Explorer course "Agent-Based Modeling" and I hope to extend it further as time permits and the spirit moves me.  (Feel free to fork and play with it, and extend it for a future interation of the ABM course if it's cool with the staff.  I just ask that you credit me and comment here so I can check it out.)

The model was created in NetLogo 6.2.0 and can be opened in NetLogo.  Documentation is in the Info tab.
